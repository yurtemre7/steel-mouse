## 1. Creating a Standalone Executable

To create a standalone executable for distribution, follow these steps:

1. Install PyInstaller, which we will use to build the executable. You can install it using pip:

   `pip install pyinstaller`

2. Build the standalone executable with PyInstaller. The --onefile option ensures the output is a single executable file, --noconsole prevents a console window from appearing when the program is run, and --add-data includes the necessary image files:

    `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data images:images mouse.py`

## 2. Creating an Installer with Inno Setup

After creating the standalone executable, you can create an installer for the application using Inno Setup. Follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Inno Setup**: You can download Inno Setup from the [official website](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php). After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions to install Inno Setup on your computer.

2. **Open the Inno Setup Script**: Navigate to the `innosetup` folder in the project directory. Here, you will find a script file with the extension `.iss`. This is the Inno Setup script for your application. Open this script with Inno Setup.

3. **Compile the Installer**: With the script open in Inno Setup, click the "Compile" button. This will create the installer. The installer will be created in the output directory specified in the script (usually a subdirectory called `Output` in the `innosetup` folder).

Now you have an installer that you can distribute to users. They can run this installer to easily install your application on their system.

## 3. Creating the release

After creating the standalone executable and the installer, you can create a release for the application.

## CI / GitHub Actions

The repository includes a Windows GitHub Actions workflow that builds the standalone executable with PyInstaller and compiles the Inno Setup installer. You can trigger it manually from the Actions tab (use the "Run workflow" button) or by pushing changes to `mouse.py`, `requirements.txt`, or the workflow file itself. The workflow uploads the installer (`SteelMouse_Setup.exe`).
